New features/bug fixes in v2.17 revision 31
-------------------------------------------

Fixes:
- I'm proud to announce that the linux gserver
  now works (and 100% at that)
- Chest items now properly clip to the max
  when you open them.
-------------------------------------------
New features/bug fixes in v2.17 revision 30
-------------------------------------------

Additions:
- A global database of bodies, heads, shields,
  and swords has been established. You will
  be able to upload your heads to this global
  database and will be able to use it on any
  server using revision 30+. All global files
  will be 'cached' on the server itself in
  the worlds folder called 'globals'. There
  will soon be a new organized method of 
  doing this soon ( which will establish
  the folder configuration )
- AP Spawning:
  AP < 20 -> 3 hearts
  AP < 40 -> 5 hearts
  Ap >= 40 -> full hearts

Fixes:
- Memory leak causing the serverlist to crash
  should be fixed now. =)
- RemoteControl attribute-editing should no
  longer crash.
-------------------------------------------
New features/bug fixes in v2.17 revision 29
-------------------------------------------

Additions:
- ability to have nick-specific guilds or
  any-nick guilds. By default guilds are
  NOT nick-specific. To set a guild
  nick-specific, set the firstline as:
  TYPE=NICK. For an example, check:
  'guilds/guildExample.txt'
- chat is limited to 220 characters, and
  nick is limited to 200 characters.
- level protection: When logging on, if your
  level does not exist, you will be warped
  to unstick me. If unstick me does not exist,
  you will see the "Connecting" screen.
- when setting your nick, it will now have you
  wait 10 seconds before changing your nickname
  again.
- Staff commands like warpto, and summon, will
  tell you if you're not authorized.

Fixes:
- accounts can now utilize spaces to log on
  servers. The serverlist now uses the same
  method of communicating as server->player.
  ALL GSERVERS WILL BE REQUIRED TO UPDATE
  OR THEY WONT BE ABLE TO CONNECT.
- chat used to cause other props to be
  'activated'. (example: you warp to a
  non-existant level) This should no longer
  happen anymore
- flag string-arrays (setstring a,b,c,d,e;) now save
  correctly, only thing is, all your current
  flags will break when using this update,
  sorry about that.
- flags / weapons should be updated immediately
  after changing players with the rc.
- global guilds are now nickname-specific, also
  fixed a bug with being able to set your nick
  to any guild.
- guilds now use the old prefix of guild for
  the filename. Example: guildAccount_Name.txt
- props now send the correct prop if it gets
  changed after it recieves a prop. (ex. chat
  now shows when it changes after processing)
- toguild messages now display the toguild
  icon.
- you can no longer have extra spaces in the
  front of your nickname or have no name. If
  attempted, your nickname will be set to
  'unknown'.

Additions:

- All log files will now be saved in the new logs folder.

- After 20 minutes of idling you will be disconnected, this can be disabled in the server options

  - allowedglobalguilds (string list) - list of global guilds that can bypass disabling global guilds.
  - globalguilds (bool) - If true, allow global guilds
  - jaillevels (string list) - jails.txt was moved into this setting.
  - playerlisticons (string list) - statuslist.txt was moved into this setting.
  - profilevars (string list) - a list of custom profile fields in the profile.
  
  - noexplosions (bool) - If true, disables explosions (only the creator of the explosion will see it)
  
  - apsystem (bool) - If true, enables the ap system.
  - disconnectifnotmoved (bool) - If true, you will be disconnected for no movement every 20 minutes.
  - heartlimit (int) - Max heart power, should always be an integer, unexpected results may happen if you use a float.
  - shieldlimit (int) - Max shield power, should always be an integer, unexpected results may happen if you use a float.
  - swordlimit (int) - Max sword power, should always be an integer, unexpected results may happen if you use a float.

- You can now send messages to guild members by using 'toguild: `message`'
- You can now view the current admins by using the command 'showadmins'

Fixes:
- When setting guilds, with the nickname being your account, a star is correctly placed in the front to indicate you're using your account (and to also move you to the top of the playerlist ;))
- Levels shouldn't messup when tile[0,0] is placed on a straight line anymore. (entire line would be random tiles)

- Sign codes no longer mess up.
- When you set your nick and put many stars in front, all of them will be removed instead of just one.
