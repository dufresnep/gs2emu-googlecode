GServer2 was programmed in CodeBlocks (mingw C++) by 39ster
<a href="mailto:(39ster@gmail.com">(39ster@gmail.com</a>)<br>
Thanks to the following people who helped convert the old 1.39 code to 2.17:<br>

These modifications made it possible to create this new gserver that is almost 
fully compatible with graal 2.17</p>
<p><b><font size="5">Running a server</font></b></p>
<p>Ok, now that you have unpacked the gserver, you are almost ready to start it. 
Before you can start it we must do a few<br>
things. First open settings.ini. This file allows you to cange how the server 
behaves. <br>
<br>
<b>[server]</b><br>
databaseFile is the &quot;.db&quot; file that will be used by the gserver to store 
accounts and player attributes. To generate a database file<br>
run dbsetup[.exe]. Follow the instructions and a new file called gserver.db 
should be created. Set the value of<br>
databaseFile to gserver.db <i>[databaseFile = gserver.db].</i> The other values&nbsp; 
under [server] are pretty self explanatory,<br>
but make sure worldName is equal to main. If you are running two gservers from 
the same databaseFile than the worldName<br>
will need to be different and you must also create a new table with the same 
fields as the table &quot;main&quot; in db.sql and name this <br>
table the value of worldName.</p>
<p>[<b>level</b>]<br>
Changes level properties.<br>
<i>NOTE: 1 = true, 0 = false</i></p>
<p><b>[player]<br>
</b>Changes player properties.<br>
<i>NOTE: 1 = true, 0 = false</i></p>
<p><b>[listserver]<br>
</b>The list server is what the gserver connects to in order to have it appear 
in the server list. It is also used to verify account<br>
names and passwords so its also an Accounts Server.<br>
All the values are self explanatory. myIp can also be set to AUTO if you want 
the list server to find your external IP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that you have configured the server, open newaccount.ini. This file 
determines the attributes of a new player (a player that<br>
has never joined the server until now).<br>
<br>
Once that is done, copy your playerworld to the &quot;world&quot; directory. You're now 
ready to start the server.<br>
Once started you can join the server by connecting to it through the graal 
client. It should appear on the server list (if the graal client is using the 
same listIp).<br>
<br>
<font size="5"><b>Managing a server</b></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;There is a tool called the RC (Remote Control). This program can 
connect to your server and allow you to carry our<br>
administration functions. To allow player RC access, go into &quot;View Accounts&quot; and 
find their account name on the list.<br>
Right click their account and choose Edit Account. Now set their admin level to 
a value between 0 and 5 (0 having no admin power, 5 having full power). Press 
save or send and then right click their name again and choose &quot;Edit Rights&quot;. 
This shows a list of Admin rights. Choose the rights you want the player to have 
and than set their IP. The ip can be a range such as 54.33.87.*<br>
Save the account and they should now be able to access the Remote Control.</p>
