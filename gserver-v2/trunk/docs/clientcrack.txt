The Graal client will manually assemble the listserver host string.
To find an instance where the client is trying to manually assemble a string, search for:
	mov bl,67

0x67 is the hex code for the ASCII letter g.

If you are trying to replace, for example, listserver.graalonline.com with your own
listserver hostname, keep in mind that your host name MUST fit within the boundaries
of the existing host name.  If your host name is shorter, just pad the end with 0's.
