INSTALL
-----------
This program doesn't have an installer; it is a stand-alone application. You do, however, need to do the following after reading this.

1) Extract the *.ZIP file to somewhere on your computer
2) Open the new folder and run the application.

-------------------------
LEVEL TEMPLATE
-------------------------
The level template is provided as the program needs it to create new level files. If the level file isn't stored in the same folder as the program then the program will close when you attempt to generate a new level.

You can use any level file you wish in this folder as long as it is called 'template.nw' and is stored in the folder so the program can access is. This means you can edit the template file so your gmap is created with custom template levels.
