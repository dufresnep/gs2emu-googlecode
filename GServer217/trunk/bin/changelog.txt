--------------------------------------------
New features/bug fixes in v2.171 build 55
--------------------------------------------

Maintenance:
- Re-did a lot of the RC messages to be less Engrishy and more consistent.
- Added a new function: CBuffer::findIn().  It basically calls strstr() on
  the data in the CBuffer class.  Could be useful for GServer modders.

Additions:
- RCs who have the "change rights" ability can no longer give rights that
  they themselves do not have.
- When opening the FileBrowser on RC, it should now properly read the
  LastFolder line in your account and open that directory.  It used to just
  open the first directory in your folder rights.

Fixes:
- Modified the GServer init message to say Build instead of Revision since
  we aren't using the Revision nomenclature anymore.
- Fixed NPC props.  Being a bonehead, Nalin wrote code to attempt to fix
  NPC props in build 54 but never actually called it.
