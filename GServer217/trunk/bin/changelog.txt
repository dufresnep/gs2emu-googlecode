--------------------------------------------
New features/bug fixes in v2.171 build 55
--------------------------------------------

Maintenance:
- Re-did all of the RC messages to be less Engrishy and more consistent.
- Added a new function: CBuffer::findIn().  It basically calls strstr() on
  the data in the CBuffer class.  Could be useful for GServer modders.

Additions:
- Players who have the "Change Staff Accounts" right can now evade local
  server bans.  Remember to remove that right from any admin you ban.
- The "Get Accounts List" dialog in RC is now fully implemented again.  Both
  the "Account name description" and the "Conditions" field accept wildcard
  characters.  The wildcard characters %, *, and ? are supported, with %
  acting the same as *.  The "Conditions" field searches the account .txt
  files for matches.  "swordp=2" will search for everybody who's "swordp"
  value in their account .txt file is equal to 2.  "level=rha_*,ap=51" will
  search for the level value that starts with "rha_" and whose ap value is
  51.  View the accounts .txt file for all the values.  Note that the values
  "CHEST", "WEAPON", "FLAG", and "FOLDERRIGHT" don't currently work.
- RCs who have the "change rights" ability can no longer give rights that
  they themselves do not have.
- When opening the FileBrowser on RC, it should now properly read the
  LastFolder line in your account and open that directory.  It used to just
  open the first directory in your folder rights.

Fixes:
- Fixed NPC props for real this time.  Possibly.
- Fixed client login props.  I don't know if there will be any noticeable
  difference or not, but it is fixed.
- Fixed player heart formatting in the player profile menu.  Instead of
  showing 3.00, it will now show 3.  Instead of 2.50, it now shows 2.5.
- If the player attempts to log into a non-existent level, they will now
  be sent correctly to the unstick me level.
- Chatting doesn't reset the unstick me timer anymore.
- Logging in to a non-existent level should now properly send the player to
  the unstick me level.
- When a player logs into RC, the "Players" field in RC is now correctly
  incremented, RC announces to the player that they logged in, and the player
  now correctly appears in the Player List.
- Modified the GServer init message to say Build instead of Revision since
  we aren't using the Revision nomenclature anymore.
- Fixed an issue where attempting to log in twice on the same account
  would permanently add 1 to the player count.
