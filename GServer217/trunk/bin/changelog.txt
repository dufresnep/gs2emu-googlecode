--------------------------------------------
New features/bug fixes in v2.171 build 55
--------------------------------------------

Maintenance:
- Re-did all of the RC messages to be less Engrishy and more consistent.
- Added a new function: CBuffer::findIn().  It basically calls strstr()
  on the data in the CBuffer class.  Could be useful for GServer
  modders.

Additions:
- Players who have the "Change Staff Accounts" right can now evade local
  server bans.  Remember to remove that right from any admin you ban.
- The "Get Accounts List" dialog in RC is now fully implemented again.
  Both the "Account name description" and the "Conditions" field accept
  wildcard characters.  The wildcard characters %, *, and ? are
  supported, with % acting the same as *.  The "Conditions" field
  searches the account .txt files for matches.  "swordp=2" will search
  for everybody who's "swordp" value in their account .txt file is equal
  to 2.  "level=rha_*,ap=51" will search for the level value that starts
  with "rha_" and whose ap value is 51.  "ap=51,flag=System_Hearts=1"
  will search for players whose ap is 51 and who have the flag
  "System_Hearts=1" in their account.  View the accounts .txt file for
  all the values.
- RCs who have the "change rights" ability can no longer give rights
  that they themselves do not have.
- When opening the FileBrowser on RC, it should now properly read the
  LastFolder line in your account and open that directory.  It used to
  just open the first directory in your folder rights.

Fixes:
- Some more work on NPC props.  The gserver should now correctly save
  NPC prop changes and correctly save the time the player left the
  level.  This results in NPCs that work better and faster level load
  times; however, the "created" flag is still broken so you should still
  be working around that.  Make use of the isleader flag in your
  "playerenters" code section workarounds for changing certain npc props
  (like the NPC gani) for maximum compatibility.
- Fixed client login props.  I don't know if there will be any
  noticeable difference or not, but it is fixed.
- Fixed player heart formatting in the player profile menu.  Instead of
  showing 3.00, it will now show 3.  Instead of 2.50, it now shows 2.5.
- If the player attempts to log into a non-existent level, they will now
  be sent correctly to the unstick me level.
- Chatting doesn't reset the unstick me timer anymore.
- Logging in to a non-existent level should now properly send the player
  to the unstick me level.
- When a player logs into RC, the "Players" field in RC is now correctly
  incremented, RC announces to the player that they logged in, and the
  player now correctly appears in the Player List.
- Modified the GServer init message to say Build instead of Revision
  since we aren't using the Revision nomenclature anymore.
- Fixed an issue where attempting to log in twice on the same account
  would permanently add 1 to the player count.
- Re-enabled kicking for bad packets.
