How-to setup a server:

 1) Under the accounts folder, rename the text file 'YOURACCOUNT.txt' to your account name.ex: 'KuJi.txt'
 2) Open server options and edit the things below "Private-Server Options", by default you should be able to just open the gserver and run it.
 3) Add your account name under the staff server option and then save the serveroptions.txt
 4) Port forward if needed.
 5) Run winGserver.exe -- enjoy.
