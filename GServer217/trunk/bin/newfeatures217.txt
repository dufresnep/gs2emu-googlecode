New features/bug fixes in v2.171 build 56
--------------------------------------------

Maintenance:
- Fixed the tiling errors in the packaged onlinestartlocal.nw.
- Re-worked most of the console messages.
- The log files now display everything on one line.
- Re-worked the RC messages again to send to all RC's and to display
  the account name of the player who sent the packet.

Additions:
- Added the new serveroptions.txt option "detailedconsole".  It is a
  boolean value that defaults to false.  If true, it will display the
  old detailed console messages.
- The GServer now prints less console messages and in a less detailed
  format.

Fixes:
- More NPC props fixes.


--------------------------------------------
New features/bug fixes in v2.171 build 55
--------------------------------------------

Maintenance:
- Re-did all of the RC messages to be less Engrishy and more consistent.
- Added a new function: CBuffer::findIn().  It basically calls strstr()
  on the data in the CBuffer class.  Could be useful for GServer
  modders.

Additions:
- Players who have the "Change Staff Accounts" right can now evade local
  server bans.  Remember to remove that right from any admin you ban.
- The "Get Accounts List" dialog in RC is now fully implemented again.
  Both the "Account name description" and the "Conditions" field accept
  wildcard characters.  The wildcard characters %, *, and ? are
  supported, with % acting the same as *.  The "Conditions" field
  searches the account .txt files for matches.  "swordp=2" will search
  for everybody who's "swordp" value in their account .txt file is equal
  to 2.  "level=rha_*,ap=51" will search for the level value that starts
  with "rha_" and whose ap value is 51.  "ap=51,flag=System_Hearts=1"
  will search for players whose ap is 51 and who have the flag
  "System_Hearts=1" in their account.  View the accounts .txt file for
  all the values.
- RCs who have the "change rights" ability can no longer give rights
  that they themselves do not have.
- When opening the FileBrowser on RC, it should now properly read the
  LastFolder line in your account and open that directory.  It used to
  just open the first directory in your folder rights.

Fixes:
- Some more work on NPC props.  The gserver should now correctly save
  NPC prop changes and correctly save the time the player left the
  level.  This results in NPCs that work better and faster level load
  times; however, the "created" flag is still broken so you should still
  be working around that.  Make use of the isleader flag in your
  "playerenters" code section workarounds for changing certain npc props
  (like the NPC gani) for maximum compatibility.
- Fixed client login props.  I don't know if there will be any
  noticeable difference or not, but it is fixed.
- Fixed player heart formatting in the player profile menu.  Instead of
  showing 3.00, it will now show 3.  Instead of 2.50, it now shows 2.5.
- If the player attempts to log into a non-existent level, they will now
  be sent correctly to the unstick me level.
- Chatting doesn't reset the unstick me timer anymore.
- Logging in to a non-existent level should now properly send the player
  to the unstick me level.
- When a player logs into RC, the "Players" field in RC is now correctly
  incremented, RC announces to the player that they logged in, and the
  player now correctly appears in the Player List.
- Modified the GServer init message to say Build instead of Revision
  since we aren't using the Revision nomenclature anymore.
- Fixed an issue where attempting to log in twice on the same account
  would permanently add 1 to the player count.
- Re-enabled kicking for bad packets.


--------------------------------------------
New features/bug fixes in v2.171 build 54
--------------------------------------------

Maintenance:
- Replaced all 4-character spaces with actual tabs in all the source files.
- Improved Visual Studio compatibility by fixing up some headers and
  removing some includes.

Additions:
- Push-pull blocks can now be clientside.  The serveroptions.txt variable
  clientsidepushpull turns this behavior on and off.  It is a boolean
  value, so adding clientsidepushpull = false to your serveroptions.txt
  will allow all players to see push-pull blocks move.
- NPCs now send gani attributes 6-9.  The client doesn't send props 10-30
  so it is impossible to use those, for now.

Fixes:
- Fixed the 'destroy' command not destroying NPCs.  Don't ask how.
  It isn't pretty.
- Changed it so only the people who have the "Change staff accounts" right
  are able to edit the default account.
- Fixed NPC props.  Sorta.  Shields don't disappear and hopefully other
  wonky stuff won't happen.  We'll see.
- The join command will now work in .graal levels and in putnpc npc code.
- Some other stuff that may or may not fix current/future bugs.  D:


--------------------------------------------
New features/bug fixes in v2.171 build 53
--------------------------------------------

Maintenance:
- Fixed up Linux compile problems and fixed some source issues to improve
  compatibility.
- Potentially improved stability.
- Some formatting and default values were assaulted in an effort to keep
  myself sane.

Additions:
- Removed newaccount.ini.  Instead, defaultaccount.txt inside the accounts
  folder is used to specify the default account attributes of new players.
  Because of this, you can now change the default account attributes a player
  starts with through RC (flags, weapons, start level, etc.)  Just modify the
  account named "defaultaccount" through the accounts list.
- Added new server option, "defaultweapons".  It is a boolean value that
  defaults to "true".  If false, it will prevent the client from obtaining any
  of the default weapons like bow, fireblast, and nukeshot.

Fixes:
- Thanks to the pure oozing awesomeness of Joey, who is way more awesome than
  myself (who spent countless hours only to fail), the problem where the Bomb
  npc loads no matter what was solved in a matter of minutes.  D:
- Changed "horsetime" to "horselifetime" in the settings loading code to
  correctly reflect the name in serveroptions.txt and fixed a crash that could
  result from it.
- Fixed the loading and saving of NPC weapons with no image to weapons.txt.
  This fixes problems where hidden system npcs with no image were not being
  reloaded properly when the gserver was restarted.
- When a client grabs an updated weapon while an old version exists locally,
  they will correctly receive the new version.
- Updating the server flags through RC should now send that change to all
  clients.
- Fixed offline attribute editing by RC's.  It now won't erase the player's
  weapon list.
- Altering a player's flags and weapons through RC now properly sends the
  changes to the player.
- When you log into RC, it now uses the specified nickname instead of your
  account name.
- Fixed RC player folder rights saving.  It was previously limited to 255
  characters worth of directories.
- Fixed a bug where RC would freeze if you tried to download a file that ended
  in a newline character.
- Possibly fixed a bug where you could randomly disconnect while uploading
  large files through RC.
- Began work on improving support for the 'join' command.  It now dumps the
  joined code to the end of the file and leaves a semi-colon in place of the
  join command.  It also won't be executed from the inside of a multi-line
  comment anymore.

  and swords has been established. You will
  be able to upload your heads to this global
  database and will be able to use it on any
  server using revision 30+. All global files
  will be 'cached' on the server itself in
  the worlds folder called 'globals'. There
  will soon be a new organized method of 
  doing this soon ( which will establish
  the folder configuration )

New features/bug fixes in v2.17 revision 29
-------------------------------------------

Additions:
- ability to have nick-specific guilds or
  any-nick guilds. By default guilds are
  NOT nick-specific. To set a guild
  nick-specific, set the firstline as:
  TYPE=NICK. For an example, check:
  'guilds/guildExample.txt'
- chat is limited to 220 characters, and
  nick is limited to 200 characters.
- level protection: When logging on, if your
  level does not exist, you will be warped
  to unstick me. If unstick me does not exist,
  you will see the "Connecting" screen.
- when setting your nick, it will now have you
  wait 10 seconds before changing your nickname
  again.
- Staff commands like warpto, and summon, will
  tell you if you're not authorized.

Fixes:
- accounts can now utilize spaces to log on
  servers. The serverlist now uses the same
  method of communicating as server->player.
  ALL GSERVERS WILL BE REQUIRED TO UPDATE
  OR THEY WONT BE ABLE TO CONNECT.
- chat used to cause other props to be
  'activated'. (example: you warp to a
  non-existant level) This should no longer
  happen anymore
- flag string-arrays (setstring a,b,c,d,e;) now save
  correctly, only thing is, all your current
  flags will break when using this update,
  sorry about that.
- flags / weapons should be updated immediately
  after changing players with the rc.
- global guilds are now nickname-specific, also
  fixed a bug with being able to set your nick
  to any guild.
- guilds now use the old prefix of guild for
  the filename. Example: guildAccount_Name.txt
- props now send the correct prop if it gets
  changed after it recieves a prop. (ex. chat
  now shows when it changes after processing)
- toguild messages now display the toguild
  icon.
- you can no longer have extra spaces in the
  front of your nickname or have no name. If
  attempted, your nickname will be set to
  'unknown'.
