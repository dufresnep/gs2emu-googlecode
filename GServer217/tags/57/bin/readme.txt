How-to setup a server:

1) Under the accounts folder, rename the text file 'YOURACCOUNT.txt' to your account name.  For example: 'KuJi.txt'
2) Modify defaultaccount.txt to your liking.  This is the default settings new players will start with.
3) Open serveroptions.txt and edit the things below "Private-Server Options" to your liking.  Help for what these options do are available on the forums.
4) Find the line that starts with "staff =" in serveroptions.txt.  Replace YOURACCOUNT with your account name.  Anybody who needs RC access must be added to this line with their account names separated by commas.
5) Port forward if needed. (Many threads on this topic exist in the forums.  If you are having trouble, seek them out.)  Basically, if you are behind a router and your computer isn't set to be the "DMZ", you will need to port forward.
6) Run winGserver.exe -- enjoy.
7) Report any bugs on http://www.graal.in/
