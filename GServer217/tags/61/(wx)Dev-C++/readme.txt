For Dev-C++ or wxDev-C++ users:
Open it in (wx)Dev-C++.
Go to project options.
Change the directory under Libraries to point to codeblocks/libs.
Compile =]

Edited by Joey:
I pointed the libraries to go out one directory and
into the codeblocks directory. Also made it always
compile and add to the bin folder. Should work for
anyone who has an install of Dev-C++ simply by
opening, and pressing compile. Setup is done. ;)
